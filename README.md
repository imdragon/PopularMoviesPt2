# PopularMoviesPt2

This app allows you to access The Movie Database via their API for details regarding the most popular movies and highest rated films at the moment of the request.

In order for this app to work you will need to supply your own API key, which you can request from www.themoviedb.org once you create an account there. If you are building this app on your own machine, then either hardcode your key wherever I place a call to the API or create a new resource xml file named apiKey.xml and place your key in there as a String named "apiKey" to use my existing code.
